# Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS)

A **Python-based IDPS** integrating **real-time link scanning, redis caching and anomaly detection** to enhance security.

## Problem Statement
Traditional **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS)** rely heavily on signature-based methods, making them ineffective against **zero-day attacks and evolving cyber threats**. Additionally, **high false-positive rates** and **lack of scalability** hinder their efficiency. This project aims to **enhance threat detection capabilities** using **machine learning, real-time scanning, and containerization**, providing a **scalable and proactive security solution**.

----

## Features & Objectives
1. **Real-time Link Scanning**: Detects malicious URLs using **VirusTotal API** and web scraping.  
2. **Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unknown threats beyond traditional signature-based methods.    
3. **Caching with Redis**: Optimizes performance for faster threat analysis.  
5. **Real-time Alerts & Monitoring**: Notifies users/admins about potential security threats.  

----

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, Javascript
- **Backend**: Python (Flask)
- **Database and Caching**: PostgreSQL,Redis
- **APIs & Tools**: VirusTotal API,VS code

----

## Future Scope
1. **Advanced AI Models**: Enhancing anomaly detection with deep learning for better accuracy.  
2. **Threat Intelligence Expansion**: Integrating with global databases to detect emerging threats.  
3. **Cloud Deployment**: Deploying IDPS on **multi-cloud environments** for enterprise scalability.  
4. **Automated Response Mechanisms**: Implementing AI-driven **automated threat mitigation** strategies.
